The dataset covers gun violence in the United States from 2006 to 2020. It includes
details such as age, location, intent, education, and police involvement for each incident.
This comprehensive dataset provides insights into the dynamics of gun-related
incidents over a 15-year period, allowing for analyses of trends and patterns related to
age, geographical location, motives, educational background, and interactions with law
enforcement.
I chose a U.S. gun deaths dataset for my project because it provided an opportunity to
explore important aspects of gun-related incidents in this country. This dataset helped
me understand factors such as who was affected, where these incidents occurred, and
the reasons behind themâ€”whether they were intentional, accidental, or due to other
factors. In essence, it was a meaningful choice for my project, enabling me to use data to
gain insights and issues related to gun violence in the United States.
